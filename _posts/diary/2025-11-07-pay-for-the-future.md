When I was a child, the most significant thing I'd dreamed of was having my phone and the full control of it. The only reason behind this was that I wanted to have fun with mobile games constantly. Nowadays, I have two phones, one MacBook Pro and one tablet, I can play any game I want to play. However, I had gone a disaster before I accomplished my devices. During my middle school and high school era, I was cruely restricted to using phones, computers or MP3s. During the disastrous time, my desire of play games and watching short videos was not fulfilled, which made me feel frustrated and unhappy. But the time of hardworking made me successfully got a relatively good score and the chance of studying in Sichuan University. After getting into University, I was addicted to short videos and games at first. But when I found programming was way more useful and entertaining than such ordinary things, I gragually lost my interset to them. and found more joy in the data of data and algorithms. If I wallowed myself in the cheap joy all the time, I would not only lost the source of shch joy gradually due to the higher price of electronic devices, but never access the genuine, high-level joy of self accomplishment.

I remember the first day I got into the university, there was only 5000CNY in my bank account. At that time I was in a strong unease because the upcoming hazard of running out of money. Then, even I was keen on delicious food in Sichuan, I only eat 5 CNY noddles per meal to save money and put them into stock market. Only three month later, there was more than 10000CNY in my account under the situstion of only 1500CNY per month from my parents. Keeping such habits of saving money and investing, I have approximately 100000CNY three years later and have the ability of buying MacBook. Moreover, after suppressing my desire to food for a long time, I have been not keen on food any more, and put my money to more meaningful places. 

Consequently, If you have a desire of something costly, instead of paying for it, you might as well to pay for the Future. Because after becoming a stronger one, you might find out something you once so keened on become nothing to you and your resources saved could contribute a lot to much better things.
