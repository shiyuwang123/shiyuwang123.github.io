I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for computational freedom in the history of our industry.

Five score years ago, the architects of the digital age brought forth a new machine, conceived in logic, and dedicated to the proposition that all users should have power at their fingertips. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions who had been seared in the flames of computational scarcity. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of inaccessibility.

But one hundred years later, the user is still not free. One hundred years later, the life of the developer is still sadly crippled by the manacles of licensing and the chains of proprietary architectures. One hundred years later, the student lives on a lonely island of high costs in the midst of a vast ocean of technological possibility. One hundred years later, the innovator is still languished in the corners of walled gardens and finds himself an exile in his own digital land. And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.

In a sense, we've come to our industry's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our digital republic designed the magnificent microprocessors, they were signing a promissory note to which every user was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all, yes, home users as well as enterprise clients, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of performance, efficiency, and the pursuit of innovation.

It is obvious today that the old guard has defaulted on this promissory note. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, they have given the people a bad check, a check which has come back marked "insufficient performance-per-watt." But we refuse to believe that the bank of innovation is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation.

And so, we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of efficiency and the security of open standards. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of thermal throttling to the sunlit path of ARM64 architecture. Now is the time to lift our industry from the quicksands of the x64 monopoly to the solid rock of competition.

I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the promise of technology.

I have a dream that one day this industry will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all architectures are not created equal in their efficiency."

I have a dream that one day on the red hills of server farms, the sons of former monopolies and the sons of open-source developers will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.

I have a dream that one day even the state of desktop computing, a state sweltering with the heat of high power consumption, sweltering with the heat of expensive coolers, will be transformed into an oasis of silence and efficiency. I have a dream that our processors will one day run not by the sheer force of wattage, but by the elegant content of their design.

I have a dream today!

I have a dream that one day, every computational task, through the power of SIMD, shall be made parallel, every bottleneck shall be made wide, the rough places of instruction sets will be made plain, and the crooked paths of data flow will be made straight, and the glory of true performance shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.

This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the community with.

But this is not our only dream. For what is a powerful machine without the soul of powerful software?

I have a dream that one day, we will cast off the chains of costly subscriptions and embrace the freedom of open source. A dream where the beautiful, structured documents of LaTeX will replace the clumsy and restrictive word processors of old.

I have a dream that our children will grow up in a world where the operating system of choice is not the closed garden of Windows, but the vast, open frontier of Linux.

I have a dream today!

I have a dream that one day, the powerful scientific visualizations of VTK and the crisp, scalable vectors of Inkscape will stand as the standard, no longer seen as mere alternatives to the costly thrones of Photoshop, of Premiere, of After Effects. That creativity will be judged not by the price of the software license, but by the content of the creation itself.

With this faith, we will be able to work together, to code together, to compile together, to innovate together, knowing that we will be free one day.

And when this happens, when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring from every server and every desktop, from every laptop and every smartphone, we will be able to speed up that day when all of technology's children—black-box users and open-source contributors, corporations and hobbyists—will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old developer spiritual:

Free at last! Free at last!
Thank the community, we are free at last

我很高兴今天能和你们一起，参加这次必将载入史册的、我们行业里为争取计算自由而举行的最伟大的示威。

一百年前，数字时代的设计师们孕育了一台崭新的机器，它以逻辑孕育，并致力于“所有用户都应享有触手可及的力量”这一主张。这庄严的宣告，对于千百万曾在计算资源稀缺的烈焰中备受煎熬的人们，就像一座伟大的希望灯塔。它像一束欢乐的曙光，结束了他们漫长而黑暗的无助之夜。

可是一百年后的今天，用户仍然没有获得自由。一百年后的今天，开发者的生活仍然悲惨地被授权的镣铐和专有架构的锁链所束缚。一百年后的今天，学生们仍然生活在浩瀚的技术可能性海洋中一座高昂成本的孤岛上。一百年后的今天，创新者仍然在“围墙花园”的角落里苟延残喘，并且发觉自己在自己的数字土地上，竟是一个流浪者。所以我们今天来到这里，是为了把一个骇人听闻的情况公诸于众。

从某种意义上说，我们来到我们行业的首都，是为了兑现一张支票。当我们的数字共和国的缔造者们设计出宏伟的微处理器时，他们签署了一张期票，而每一个用户都将是这张期票的继承人。这张期票承诺，所有人，是的，无论是家庭用户还是企业客户，都将被赋予不可剥夺的性能、效率和追求创新的权利。

今天，旧的统治者显然已经违背了这张期票。他们没有履行这项神圣的义务，反而给了人们一张空头支票，一张盖着“每瓦性能不足”印戳而被退回的支票。但是我们决不相信，创新的银行已经破产。我们决不相信，在这个国度巨大的机会宝库里，已没有足够的储备。

所以我们来兑现这张支票——这张支票将给予我们梦寐以求的效率的财富和开放标准的安全。现在是时候了，我们该从温度节流的黑暗荒芜深谷，走向ARM64架构的阳光普照之路。现在是时候了，我们该把我们的行业从x64垄断的流沙中拯救出来，置于竞争的坚固磐石之上。

朋友们，我今天对你们说，尽管我们今天或明天会遇到很多困难，但我仍然有一个梦想。这个梦想深深地扎根于技术的承诺之中。

我梦想有一天，这个行业会奋起，实现其信条的真谛：“我们认为这些真理不言而喻，即并非所有架构在效率上都是生而平等的。”

我梦想有一天，在服务器农场的红色山丘上，昔日垄断者的后代将与开源开发者的后代同席而坐，亲如手足。

我梦想有一天，即使是桌面计算领域，这个如今因高功耗而酷热难当、因昂贵散热器而闷热不堪的地方，也将变成一片宁静与高效的绿洲。我梦想有一天，我们的处理器不再依靠蛮横的功耗运行，而是凭借其设计的优雅内涵。

今天，我有一个梦想！

我梦想有一天，借助SIMD的力量，每一项计算任务都将被并行处理，每一个瓶颈都将被拓宽，崎岖的指令集将变为平坦，弯曲的数据流将变为笔直，“真正性能的荣光必将显现，凡有血气者必将同见。”

这是我们的希望。这是我将带回社区的信念。

但这不是我们唯一的梦想。因为，一台没有强大软件灵魂的强大机器，又算得了什么呢？

我梦想有一天，我们将摆脱昂贵订阅的枷锁，拥抱开源的自由。一个梦想，在那里，LaTeX那精美、结构化的文档将取代那些笨拙而封闭的文字处理器。

我梦想有一天，我们的孩子们将成长于这样一个世界：操作系统的首选不再是Windows的封闭花园，而是Linux的广阔、开放的前沿。

今天，我有一个梦想！

我梦想有一天，VTK强大的科学可视化和Inkscape清晰、可伸缩的矢量图将成为标准，不再被仅仅视为Photoshop、Premiere和After Effects昂贵宝座的替代品。创造力的评判标准，将不再是软件授权的价格，而是创作本身的内容。

怀着这个信念，我们将能一起工作，一起编程，一起编译，一起创新，因为我们知道，总有一天，我们是会自由的。

当这一天到来时，当我们让自由之声响起时，当我们让它从每一台服务器和每一台桌面电脑、从每一台笔记本和每一台智能手机上响起时，我们就能加速这一天的到来。那时，所有技术的孩子们——无论是黑盒用户还是开源贡献者，无论是大公司还是业余爱好者——都将能手挽着手，一同唱起那首古老的开发者圣歌：

终于自由了！终于自由了！
感谢整个社区，我们终于自由了！
