## Introduction

In the modern software landscape, the choice of softwares, libraries, and frameworks can significantly impact the user experience, cost and the cross-platform compatibility of your usage. This post explains my viewpoint on software selection, focusing on reducing cost, avoiding vendor lock-in, and ensuring cross-platform compatibility.

## Cost Control

There are two kinds of software: free and paid. Choosing free software in your own life has an essential benefit. Any paid software will have a cost, while their low level essentialities are the same as free softwares, they are all use the same cpu architecture via the same operating system, built by the same programming languages, the same compilers, and the same libraries. However, paid software often comes with a cost, which is totally fucking nonsense and can be a significant burden for users. Free software, on the other hand, allows users to access essential functionalities without financial constraints. So, I always choose free software in my own life.

## Source Code Availability

The another advantage of free softwares is that they often provide access to their source code. This is a crucial factor regarding software selection.
